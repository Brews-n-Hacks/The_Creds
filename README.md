# KIA ORA! I'm Ryan Pearson
A little about me â€“ I'm a devoted Christian, proud father, and loving husband. Instead of settling for a mundane job, I've been fortunate enough to turn my passion for learning, problem-solving, and all things tech into my vocation. Who knew you could make a living doing what you love?!

I'm a cybersecurity professional and enthusiast, with 4 years experience from various roles in the field, after building other technical and interpersonal skills, spanning over 15 years and several industries. I'm currently supporting CISA's mission in our nation's Cyber Hygiene. But before diving headfirst into this thrilling field, my journey led me through diverse paths in healthcare social services and mobile sales.

Drawing from these experiences, I bring to the table a unique set of skills. From clear and personable communication to demystifying complex concepts for diverse audiences, my background equips me to make meaningful contributions to both my teams and clients. Plus, my understanding of the healthcare and telecommunications industries adds an extra layer of insight to the mix.
