# Description
This video was my final project in CYBR-101 (Introduction to Cybersecurity). I spent a lot of time researching what it means to be on a Red Team and how to get there; I spent a lot of time researching video editing as well, and I believe this showcases how quickly I can pick up new skills as I have never made a video before. I was happy to go above and beyond the requirements for the assignment, due to my passion for this career path.
